  ## Description
This project uses both MySQL and ORM Sequelize to create and manipulate data - presumably for use by an ecommerce store. The intended use is for a online shopkeeper to create and manipulate data (primarily categories, products and tags) in order to remain competitive within the industry. Ultimately this application could be used for professional or personal applications given the ability to post, put and delete.
